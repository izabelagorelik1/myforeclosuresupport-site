      <div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-6">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-extrabold text-slate-900 mb-4">How foreclosure works in New Jersey</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          New Jersey is a <strong>judicial foreclosure</strong> state, which means your lender must go through the court system to foreclose on your home.
          That process can feel intimidating and confusing — especially when terms like <em>pre-foreclosure</em>, <em>lis pendens</em>, and <em>sheriff sale</em> start showing up in your mail.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-500 text-sm mb-6">
          The information below is general and for educational purposes only, not legal advice. For legal guidance, speak with a New Jersey foreclosure attorney or HUD-approved housing counselor.
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">1. Pre-foreclosure: you’re behind, but not out of options</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
              Pre-foreclosure generally begins after you fall behind on mortgage payments. Your lender may send late notices, default letters, and loss-mitigation offers.
              During this stage, many New Jersey homeowners still have time to:
            </p>
            <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700 space-y-1">
              <li>Request a repayment plan or forbearance</li>
              <li>Apply for a loan modification or refinance</li>
              <li>Sell the home (including a possible short sale)</li>
              <li>Connect with New Jersey foreclosure mediation or counseling programs, if eligible</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">2. Foreclosure complaint and lis pendens (lawsuit is filed)</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
              If missed payments aren’t resolved, the lender can file a foreclosure complaint in court and record a <strong>lis pendens</strong> with the county clerk.
              A lis pendens is public notice that a foreclosure lawsuit involving your property is pending.
              You may have a limited time to respond to the complaint, explore mediation, or raise defenses with the help of professionals.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">3. Judgment and scheduling of a New Jersey sheriff sale</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
              If the court ultimately grants a final judgment of foreclosure, the lender can request a <strong>sheriff sale</strong>.
              This is a public auction where your property may be sold to the highest bidder.
              In many counties, there may be options to:
            </p>
            <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700 space-y-1">
              <li>Request limited adjournments (postponements) of the sheriff sale</li>
              <li>Apply for assistance, modification, or other loss-mitigation options before the sale</li>
              <li>Sell the home before the auction date in some circumstances</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
              The rules and timelines can differ by county, so it’s important to act quickly once you receive notice of a scheduled sheriff sale.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">4. After the sheriff sale: limited time and next steps</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
              After the sheriff sale, there may be very limited options left, depending on your situation and current New Jersey law.
              Some homeowners look at redemption possibilities, bankruptcy options, or transition plans if moving becomes necessary.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
              Wherever you are in the process — pre-foreclosure, lis pendens, or days before a sheriff auction — having a calm, clear conversation about your options can help you make decisions with less fear and more information.
