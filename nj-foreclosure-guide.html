        <section id="overview">
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">1. Big picture: New Jersey is a judicial foreclosure state</h2>
          <p>
            New Jersey uses a <strong>judicial foreclosure</strong> process. That means the lender usually has to file a lawsuit in court in order to foreclose on a home.
            Because the courts are involved, there are <em>papers, deadlines, and options</em> at different stages. It can feel overwhelming, especially if you’ve never dealt with the legal system before.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Not every case follows the exact same timeline, but most New Jersey foreclosure situations have these rough stages:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>Falling behind on mortgage payments (pre-foreclosure)</li>
            <li>Default letters and loss-mitigation offers</li>
            <li>Foreclosure complaint filed in court + lis pendens recorded</li>
            <li>Possible mediation, workout options, or defenses</li>
            <li>Final judgment of foreclosure</li>
            <li>Sheriff sale (public auction)</li>
            <li>Post-sale steps and possible move-out timeline</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Pre-foreclosure -->
        <section id="pre-foreclosure">
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">2. Pre-foreclosure in New Jersey: behind on payments</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Pre-foreclosure</strong> is the period when you’re behind on your mortgage but before the court enters a judgment and holds a sheriff sale.
            You might see late notices, default letters, and offers to apply for loss mitigation (like a loan modification).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            During pre-foreclosure, many homeowners in New Jersey still have time to:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>Talk to the lender or servicer about a repayment plan or forbearance</li>
            <li>Apply for a loan modification or refinance (if income and credit allow)</li>
            <li>Explore selling the home, including a short sale in some cases</li>
            <li>Connect with housing counseling or legal aid to understand options</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-600">
            The earlier you ask for help, the more options you generally have. Once court papers are filed or a sale date is set, things can move faster.

        <!-- Section 3: Complaint & lis pendens -->
        <section id="lis-pendens">
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">3. Foreclosure complaint and lis pendens</h2>
          <p>
            If missed payments continue and no solution is reached, the lender can file a <strong>foreclosure complaint</strong> in the New Jersey courts.
            At around the same time, they may record a document called a <strong>lis pendens</strong> with the county clerk.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            A lis pendens is a public notice that a lawsuit involving your property is pending. It doesn’t mean you’ve already lost your home, but it does signal that the case is moving forward.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Once served with a foreclosure complaint, homeowners often have a limited time to respond. Ignoring court papers can make it easier for the lender to get a judgment.
            Talking with a New Jersey foreclosure attorney or legal aid group can help you understand deadlines and possible defenses.

        <!-- Section 4: Mediation / workout -->
        <section id="mediation">
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">4. Mediation, workout options, and communication</h2>
          <p>
            In some cases, New Jersey homeowners may be able to participate in <strong>mediation</strong> or other programs aimed at exploring alternatives to foreclosure.
            Options might include:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>Loan modification or repayment plans</li>
            <li>Forbearance or temporary payment relief</li>
            <li>Short sale or deed in lieu in some situations</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2">
            These programs and rules can change over time, so it’s important to review the most current information and, when possible, get help from a housing counselor or attorney.

        <!-- Section 5: Sheriff sale -->
        <section id="sheriff-sale">
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">5. New Jersey sheriff sale (sheriff auction)</h2>
          <p>
            If the lender obtains a final judgment of foreclosure, the property can be scheduled for a <strong>sheriff sale</strong>. This is a public auction run by the county sheriff’s office where the property may be sold to the highest bidder.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            In many New Jersey counties, homeowners may have limited options to:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>Request one or more adjournments (postponements) of the sale</li>
            <li>Seek legal advice about last-minute options, including bankruptcy or other relief</li>
            <li>Try to sell the property before the auction, in some cases</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-600">
            Exact rights and timelines can depend on your facts, the county where the property is located, current law, and court decisions. A local attorney can explain how these concepts apply to you.

        <!-- Section 6: Scams & red flags -->
        <section id="scams">
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">6. Common red flags and scams to watch for</h2>
          <p>
            When people are under foreclosure stress, they can become targets. Be cautious of:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>Anyone who guarantees they can “stop your foreclosure overnight” for a large upfront fee</li>
            <li>Pressure to sign over your deed without clearly understanding the terms</li>
            <li>Requests to pay mortgage payments to a third party instead of your lender</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2">
            If a proposal sounds too good to be true or you feel rushed, it’s okay to slow down and ask more questions. Getting a second opinion from a trusted professional can help you avoid long-term harm.

          <p>
            No guide can replace advice tailored to your situation, but taking even one small step can help you feel less alone and more informed.
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>Gather your loan documents and recent letters from your lender or servicer.</li>
            <li>Make a simple timeline: when you fell behind, what notices you’ve received, and any court dates or sale dates.</li>
            <li>Reach out to a housing counselor, legal aid, or attorney to ask about your specific options.</li>

            Whatever stage you’re in — pre-foreclosure, lis pendens, or facing a sheriff sale — you don’t have to figure it out completely on your own.
